        <p><em>Founder & CEO of <strong>Koza Group</strong></em></p>
        <p>I completed my BA degree in Economics and Media Studies as well as a Bachelor of Commerce with honours in Economics at the University of the Witwatersrand. My honours course is structured around a core of microeconomics and macroeconomics
          that
          emphasises both rigorous understanding of economic concepts and the ability to apply them to a range of economic research and policy questions.
          Through my economics and media studies courses in my BA degree, I have gained both a broader commercial and cultural awareness of the media industry. I am highly organized, able to manage multiple tasks and consistently meet deadlines. I
          believe
          these skills together with my ambition, hard work and willingness to learn can enable me to be a valuable addition to any organisation.
